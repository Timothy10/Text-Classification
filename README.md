# Text-Classification
This is a repo for my text classification algorithms

Inputs:
1) Text articles from a given pre-defined topic
2) Labels of which articles belong to the topic and which ones don't

Outputs:
1) Logistic regression model based on tf-idf features, that gives a prediction for each article regarding whether the article is appropriate for the topic.
-ngrams with the corresponding logit weights
-confidence values for each prediction
-test results from parameter tuning
